## Overview
Omar and I were given an assignment to compare the ride share income of different city types. We are going to review the data and plot it using Matplotlib. We are going to also summarize the data as well in a table.

## Result
Looking at the table, you can see that the urban enviroment is getting a lot more money than the rest of the city types by a wide margin. The graph also shows that they have a similar pattern over time as well with a little deviation here and there.

There is another thing that is interesting. If you look at the table, The amount of income is inversely proportion to the average. This is caused by urban cities having significantly more people with less travel distance than suburban and rural cities.
