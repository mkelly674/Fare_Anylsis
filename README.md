# Fare_Anylsis
## Overview
Omar and I were given an assignment to compare the ride share income of different city types. We are going to review the data and plot it using Matplotlib. We are going to also summarize the data as well in a table.

## Result
Looking at the table, you can see that the urban enviroment is getting a lot more money than the rest of the city types by a wide margin. The graph also shows that they have a similar pattern over time as well with a little deviation here and there.

There is another thing that is interesting. If you look at the table, The amount of income is inversely proportion to the average. This is caused by urban cities having significantly more people with less travel distance than suburban and rural cities. The drivers also get less from each fare which can slow down a drivers individual income because of the constant stops vs a long fare with possibly bigger tips.

There is also a difference in the ratios in the number of drivers and number of rides for the city type. There are more number of rides than drivers for both rural and suburban city types. Meanwhile, the number of drivers is significantly more than the number of rides. This ratio causes the drivers to not earn as much as the other city type of drivers.

## Summary

There are a few ways to fix the issue of the ratio between drivers vs rides in the urban enviorment. One way would be to decrease the number of drivers. This lets the drivers earn more while not having to struggle getting more rides. This also might cause some problems down the line if the company wishes to grow because of the amount of time to possibly rehire and train.
Another way to fix the issue is by getting more rides so that the number of income can increase. This also helps with the decision of who to let go. This also helps with a possible misshap of the vehical and possibly lossing income for a duration of time. The down side is spending a lot more in both getting the ride and maintaning it.
The other way of fixing the problem is by possibly having the suburban enviorment share some of their vehicals. This helps with the excess of rides not being in use.
